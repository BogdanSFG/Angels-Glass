        <h2>Development through history</h2>
        <p>One concept sees the origin of technology as arising from the expedient human activity and the need for a rational use of the means of this activity. Another concept of the emergence of technology was offered by O. Spengler. Technique, in his opinion, comes from the joint activity of large masses of people and is a way of organizing this activity. Therefore, technology should be considered not as a set of tools, but as a way of handling them, that is, practically as itself a technology.
        </p>
            <p>An interesting concept of the origin of technology was offered by L. Mumford, who believes that gun and machine technology are products of biotechnology. By "biotechnology" is meant everything a person needs for life. Technique comes from the features of human functioning and, in its origin, is closely related to the origin of man. It was first of all life-oriented, and only then work-oriented. Technique, aimed at production and power, arose, according to L. Mumford, much later.</p>

            <h3>On May 24, 1844, Samuel F.B. Morse sent the first telegraph: "What hath God wrought?" The phrase, taken from the bible, was selected by the daughter of one of Morse’s friends. Since then, the way we communicate has evolved in leaps and bounds to the point where the device we (sometimes) use for phone calls can fit in our pocket and has more processing power than the room-sized computers of the 60s. New technology has connected us in many ways, making it easier to communicate and get around.

                Over the past 175 years, we’ve seen an array of emerging technologies. Here are eleven of the most significant technological advances since 1844.</h3>

            <h2>1. The Telephone — 1876</h2>
            <div class="content-flex">
            <p>The Scotsman Alexander Graham Bell worked as a speech and hearing expert (his mother and wife were both deaf) and, seeking to improve the telegraph, researched voice transmission until, in 1876, he patented the telephone. This device revolutionised communication by allowing instant speech even over long distances. In its early days, to establish a call, a person had to manually connect the wires, and this continued until the creation of the telephone network. It is one of the most significant advances of the Second Industrial Revolution, to the extent that it marks the beginning of modern society. Without it, the world would not exist as we know it today: it laid the foundations for mobile telephony.   </p>

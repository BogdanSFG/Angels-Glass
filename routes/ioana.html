            <p>The world is in a series of revolutions backed by increased innovation and discovery in the technology
                world. Information can be quickly passed from one person to the other despite their geographical
                position on earth. Digitization has entirely changed how people work, bank, shop, and carry out
                business. SMEs, corporations, and government agencies have embraced technology and digitization in their
                activities that create efficiency and significantly reduce operational costs.</p>


            <p>However, digitization is a continuous process because experts worldwide continue to invent digital
                features that continue to aid in faster, easier and efficient passage of information. Digitization has
                undergone several milestones, each with its equal share of lessons and achievements that have helped
                shape the current and future digital technology.</p>

                <p>Digitization got its start as far back as 1679 when Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed the
                    first-ever binary system. He then authored a remarkable and well-crafted book known as the
                    Explanation of Binary Systems in 1703 to help other people understand the binary system. In 1755,
                    Samuel Johnson, another pioneer of the binary system, also wrote a book to explain the binary system
                    in a broader perspective. He described it as a unique computation method that uses simple
                    progression similar to the one used by the Chinese thousands of years ago.</p>
                <p>In 1847, Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole. This unique algebra was used in the
                    mathematical analysis of logic to realize the universal spread and adoption of computation. The
                    Boolean algebra theory played a massive role in discovering mathematical logic used in digitization
                    today. He explains that the human interpretation of binary numbers and 1 is far beyond
                    understanding.</p>
                <p>As time went by, Claude Shannon, an MIT tech student, compiled his master’s thesis that exhaustively
                    centered on developing and using digital circuits. Shannon studied Boolean algebra law, which he
                    incorporated to show how digital circuits can be made and used in the telecommunication industry. He
                    is the brains behind telephone routing digital technology.</p>

                <h2 id="the1900s">The 1900s</h2>
                <h3>Pulse Code Modulation</h3>
                <p>In 1938, Alec Reeves continued his research on the binary language and how to digitize it. Alec
                    discovered the PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) technology that enables effective and successful voice
                    calls in the telecommunication industry. He presented his samples of analog signals, but Alec’s
                    technology was not up for commercial use until the 1950s when the transistor was discovered.

                </p>


                <h3>Digital voice transmission</h3>
                <p>John V. Atanasoff drafted the paper ‘Computing machine for the Solution of Large Systems of Linear
                    Algebraic Equations’ in 1940 to introduce and extensively describe the digital calculating machine.
                    He had built this electronic digital machine with his friend, Clifford Berry, as they were learning
                    more about modernized computation. This technology increased the capacity of data that would be
                    stored and processed by digital devices such as computers.

                    In 1943, yet another milestone was achieved in the digital tech world. The first-ever digital voice
                    transmission technology known as the SIGSALY was discovered. This technology was embraced,
                    especially by the troops, to secretly and effectively communicate with fellow allies during World
                    War II.</p>
                <img src="/resources/images/radio.jpeg" alt="first digital voice transmission technology">

                <h3>UNIVAC 1 computer</h3>
                <p>TAs invention and innovation hit the digital tech scene, the first report on the EDVAC was released
                    to its developers on June 25, 1945. The EDVAC is one of the earliest digital computers that shaped
                    the path for the invention of other digital computers. The team chose to use the binary technology
                    that made the physical components less and more powerful.

                        <h3>1954</h3>
                        <p>1954 was another excellent year for the tech and digital industry as General Electric
                            officially launched the first UNIVAC 1 computer. This was officially undertaken by the
                            company’s major plant division in Kentucky. The UNIVAC computer was the first-ever system to
                            have incorporated a payroll system in its operations in the United States. It significantly
                            increased efficiency in operations and cost-effectiveness.
                            The successful launch of the UNIVAC 1 marked a significant milestone in the history of
                            computing, symbolizing the beginning of a new era in technology. The UNIVAC 1, which stands
                            for Universal Automatic Computer, was a groundbreaking achievement in the realm of
                            electronic computing.</p>

                        <p>Developed by a team led by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the UNIVAC 1 was not only the
                            first commercially produced computer but also the first to be utilized for business
                            applications such as payroll processing. Its installation at the United States Census Bureau
                            in 1951 marked the first time a computer was used for official government calculations. This
                            groundbreaking innovation laid the foundation for the integration of computers into various
                            industries, transforming the way businesses handled data and streamlined their operations.

                    <div>
                        <h3>1955</h3>
                        <p>In 1955, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company made a huge milestone of digitizing over
                            six hundred megabytes of information from two million users who had insurance policies. This
                            laid a firm foundation for developing mass digitized record-keeping systems.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having invested a lot of time and resources in digitization, IBM finally announced the
                            release of the first-ever disk storage unit in 1956. These storage units allowed users to
                            access stored data in the disk freely. The disk had a maximum storage space of up to 5
                            megabytes and could be leased for about $3,200 a month. United Airlines was the first
                            company to purchase the storage disk for its reservation system. The system would later
                            service 84,000 phone calls and store 807 megabytes of reservation data for the airline from
                            1960.

                        <h3>Machine Readable Cataloging Records</h3>
                        <p>In 1963, Charles Bachmanand developed an integrated data store that became one of the first
                            successfully integrated management systems in the digital world. The management system was
                            incredibly efficient and was incorporated as a navigational database for manufacturing
                            companies and industries.

                            A few years later, the US government decided to incorporate the MARC (Machine Readable
                            Cataloging Records) in the respective libraries. This system made it easy for
                            record-keeping, tracing, and various retrievable sources of information found in the
                            library.

                            The CCD (charge coupled device) was officially launched in 1969 by Willard Boyle and George
                            Smith. It turned light into digital information and shaped the future of the development of
                            cameras, telescopes, and medical imaging.</p>

                <h2 id="20Century">The Late 20th Century</h2>
                <h3>A revolutionary time for digitization</h3>
                <p>The end of the 20th century became a revolutionary time for digitization. The 1970s saw the launch of
                    the Pulsar, the first watch in the world to showcase a digital display, and the first digital
                    camera. In 1979, the government launched the COSMOS system (Customers, Operations and Services
                    Management Operating System) that handles people, packages, and transport services.

                    In August 1982, the first-ever compact disk was launched. By 1984, 8.2% of American households owned
                    Personal Computers. WELL, (Whole Earth’s Lectronic Link) was also founded, making it the first
                    virtual community.</p>


                <h3>Digital transmission of television networks</h3>
                <p>In 1990, General Electric launched the race to launch a digital television, while Finland launched
                    its first 2G network in 1991. In 1994, the first online transaction was made – a pizza ordered from
                    Pizza Hut. The first film to be produced using computer systems, Toy Story, was launched in 1995.

                    Digital transmission of television networks took shape in 1998 while Walmart bagged the most
                    extensive database system that stood close to 180 terabytes in 1999. The beginning of the year 2000
                    marked the launch of the first digital entertainment and news service, which was done by
                    MyAudio2Go.com. At the same time, digital electronic payments systems surpassed traditional payments
                    for the first time.</p>

                <h3>The Google Platform</h3>
                <p>In 2004, Google worked with multiple institutions to create a standard hub for information, which
                    became the Google platform. By 2007, 94% of the world’s news was already in digital form and Estonia
                    became the first country to vote digitally in a parliamentary seat election.</p>


                <h3>Bitcoin</h3>
                <p>Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 as a digital, decentralized, and cashless currency while online
                    advertisements surpassed newspaper advertising by a significant margin. In 2012, e-commerce hit an
                    annual yield of $1 trillion for the first time, partly due to Amazon selling more books online than
                    any physical stores.</p>
                <h3>Facebook, Twitter, Instagram</h3>
                <p>2014 marked the beginning of revenues from streaming songs and movies from various sites. The number
                    of internet users hit 3 billion in the summer of 2014. From 2015 to date, digital social platforms
                    such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have continued to change and digitize and thus making goods
                    and services efficiently and readily available.

                    <h2 id="future">The Future of Digitization</h2>
                    <h3>General Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>The world’s future heavily depends on digitization to function swiftly and efficiently.
                        Regardless of their size, business setups have been advised to brace for significant changes in
                        the way they do business. If they haven’t already, companies will have to move to digital
                        systems and a flexible, agile digital infrastructure to cope with competition from other similar
                        firms.

                        However, digitization is expected to reduce employment opportunities, especially in the auto and
                        tech industries. This is because digitization has brought about the invention and innovation of
                        artificial intelligence machines that can process information faster than humans. However,
                        online and electronic industries are expected to skyrocket their employment levels as direct
                        human labor will be needed.</p>


                    <h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
                    <p>Augmented reality (AR) is the next big thing in the digital world. AR depicts a real-life version
                        of the world by the use of digital tools such as sound and other sensory stimuli to create a
                        nearly exact perception of reality on a digital device. This technology is used by companies
                        invested in mobile computing and digital advertising.

                        Analytics will also help to shape the future of digitization. Businesses must perform regular
                        and constant analytical checks on their performance to ensure that everything is going as per
                        the set objectives. However, with improved and digitized analytics, companies can incorporate
                        computerized devices to perform thorough analytical checks for errors and irregularities in
                        their performance margins. .</p>

            <h2 id="introduction">What is Medical Technology?</h2>
                <p>Medical Technology can be defined as the technologies that diagnose, treat and/or improve a person’s health and wellbeing, encompassing both low- and high-risk medical devices – products that can be as varied from tongue depressors, surgical gloves and medical thermometers to insulin pumps, pacemakers and in vitro diagnostics – and used to save the lives of patients everywhere across Asia Pacific every day.</p>
                <p>Medical devices assist healthcare professionals to diagnose and treat patients with a higher level of accuracy and in a timelier fashion, and help patients overcome sickness or disease, improving their quality of life.</p>
                <p>And while a global definition of what defines as a medical device is difficult to establish due to the various regulatory bodies worldwide that oversee the use and categorisation of medical devices, there is a very high likelihood that people are surrounded by medical devices without even realising it.</p>

                <p>It is because of medical science that we have doubled our life expectancy since the 1900s. The current life expectancy is 70 years. It means people used to live for 35-40 years on average just a millennium ago. The huge advancement in medical technology offering brilliant inventions has made it possible. The medical inventions that changed the world will be discussed in this article.</p>
                <p>The important inventions show how we steadily advanced to a higher level years after years to achieve such a feat. Even though all the diseases have not been conquered, we have won many battles with scientific advancements. Let us find out how these inventions brought a dramatic change in the medical world.</p>

                <h2 id="ancientWorld">Medical technologies in ancient times</h2>
                <p>Many cultures in ancient times treated illnesses with magic and herbal remedies. People believed that the supernatural powers of a shaman (sha-man), also known as a medicine man or witch doctor, healed the sick. Ancient Egyptians thought that their gods healed them. They also treated illnesses with herbal medicines and performed surgeries with metal instruments. Historians believe that Egyptians learned how diseases affected the human body when they performed burial rituals. When people died, they prepared them for the afterlife in a process called mummification. Before the body was wrapped in cloths, they removed organs and placed them in clay jars for preservation.</p>

                        <p>The Romans invented numerous surgical instruments, including the first instruments unique to women, as well as the surgical uses of forceps, scalpels, cautery, cross-bladed scissors, the surgical needle, the sound, and speculas. Romans also performed cataract surgery.</p>
                        <p>The Romans adopted many Greek philosophies but made their own advancements in public health. They developed sewers to remove human waste from the cities and towns and built systems to provide clean water not only to drink, but for public baths. The baths provided a place to wash, exercise and socialize. Sophisticated hospitals were also built in ancient Rome. They were developed to take care of sick and injured soldiers, which was important to the Roman Empire because it relied on it’s army to conquer new territory.</p>

                 <p>India has one of the world's oldest medical systems. It is known as Ayurvedic medicine (Ayurveda). Ayur in Sanskrit means “life” and veda means “science” or “knowledge”; thus ayurveda is the science of life. It has evolved in India over thousands of years. In modern times, ayurveda is considered Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM): Herbs and specialized diets. Ayurvedic medicine integrates the balance of the body, mind, and spirit. It is based on theories of health and illness and on ways to prevent and promote wellness, and manage or treat health problems.</p>
                 <p>As with Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, Arabic, and Western medicine, the beginnings of Hindu medicine has its roots in magic and superstition and it developed through the centuries. As in other primitive societies, early Indian society punished wrongdoers with physical mutilation. Cutting off the nose was the usual punishment for adultery. Susruta is believed to have developed the technique of nose restorations and Indian doctors became highly skilled in nose restorations (rhinoplasty). The technique is widely practiced by plastic surgeons today and is widely known as the “nose job.” Nowadays, many people have rhinoplasty in order to conform to contemporary ideals of beauty.</p>

                <p>In Ancient Greek Medicine illness was initially regarded as a divine punishment and healing as, quite literally, a gift from the gods. However, by the 5th century BCE, there were attempts to identify the material causes for illnesses rather than spiritual ones and this led to a move away from superstition towards scientific enquiry, although, in reality, the two would never be wholly separated. Greek medical practitioners, then, began to take a greater interest in the body itself and to explore the connection between cause and effect, the relation of symptoms to the illness itself and the success or failure of various treatments.</p>
                <p>Greek medicine was not a uniform body of knowledge and practice but rather a diverse collection of methods and beliefs which depended on such general factors as geography and time period and more specific factors such as local traditions and a patient's gender and social class. Nevertheless, common threads running through Greek medical thought included a preoccupation with the positive and negative effects of diet and a belief that the patient could actually do something about their complaint, in contrast to a more fatalistic and spiritual mindset of earlier times.</p>
                <p>However, the distinction between the spiritual and physical worlds are often blurred in Greek medicine, for example, the god Asclepius was considered a dispenser of healing but also a highly skilled practical doctor. The god was called upon by patients at his various sanctuaries (notably Epidaurus) to give the patient advice through dreams which the site practitioners could then act upon. Grateful patients at the site often left monuments which reveal some of the problems that needed to be treated, they include blindness, worms, lameness, snakebites and aphasia. As Epidaurus illustrates, there could, then, be both a divine and a physical cause or remedy for illnesses.</p>
                <p>Textual sources on Greek medical practice begin with scenes from Homer's Iliad where the wounded in the Trojan War are treated, for example, Patroclus cleaning Eurypylus' wound with warm water. Medical matters and doctors are also frequently mentioned in other types of Greek literature such as comedy plays but the most detailed sources come from around 60 treatises often attributed to Hippocrates (5th to 4th century BCE), the most famous doctor of all. However, none of these medical treatises can be confidently ascribed to Hippocrates and next to nothing is known about him for certain.</p>

                <h2 id="middleAges">Medical technologies from the Middle Ages</h2>
                <p>Medieval medicine has often been portrayed as a time when physicians were ignorant and health care remained the stuff of superstitions and quackery. However, a closer look reveals that there were many ways in which medical knowledge and healthcare improved during the Middle Ages. Here are some of medieval medical advances:</p>

                <h3>Hospitals</h3>
                <img src="../resources/images/medicine/hospital_middle_ages.jpg" alt="hospital in medieval period">
                <p>By the fourth century the concept of a hospital – a place where patients could be treated by doctors with access to specialized equipment – was emerging in parts of the Roman Empire. The origins of hospitals began in Christian religious establishments that were meant to provide lodgings and care for the poor and travellers. In Byzantium and Western Europe hospitals were usually run by monasteries and gradually became larger and more complex over the Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in the Arabic world hospitals emerged in the ninth century as more secular institutions. In larger cities they could be staffed by dozens of physicians, had several wards for different illnesses, and could even have amenities like musicians playing in the halls.</p>

                <h3>Pharmacies</h3>
                <img src="../resources/images/medicine/pharmacy_middle_ages.jpg" alt="pharmacy in medieval period">
                <p>The first pharmacy was established in Baghdad in the year 754. One medieval Arabic physician explained these places were for “the art of knowing the materia medica simples in their various species, types and shapes. From these, the pharmacist prepares compounded medications as prescribed and ordered by the prescribing physician.” Pharmacies proved to be very popular and more drug stores soon opened up throughout the Arabic world. By the twelfth century they could be found in Europe. Having pharmacies greatly aided our understanding of drugs and letting more people access their benefits.</p>

                <h3>Eyeglasses</h3>
                <img src="../resources/images/medicine/eyeglasses_middle_ages.jpg" alt="">
                <p>We are not sure who invented eyeglasses to help correct vision, but by the end of the thirteenth century it seems that the product was well-known in Italy.</p>
                <p>The earliest depiction of a person wearing glasses comes from the year 1352, when Tommaso da Modena included an image of Cardinal Hugh of Provence as part of a fresco in a church. It shows the cardinal wearing the glasses as he writes at his desk.</p>
                
                <h3>Medical Education in Universities</h3>
                <img src="../resources/images/medicine/medicine_university_middle_ages.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The rise of universities throughout Europe would bring about important, but gradual, changes to the practices of medicine. Many medieval universities would teach physicians and become the main centres through which medical knowledge would be shared. </p>
                <p>In 1231 Frederick II promulgated a set of laws concerning medical education standards and licensure that were far ahead of his time. Although these laws did not have an immediate effect on medical training and practice, his codification of the importance of premedical education probably reinforced and stabilized an educational method which was developing and which became a cornerstone of the professionalization of physicians.</p>

                <h2 id="20-21centuries">Medical technologies in modern and contemporary eras </h2>
                <p>The Renaissance brought about a significant change in the history of medicine. The period between the 16th and 18th centuries was remarkable for medicine. This period saw a rapid increase in experimental investigations and advanced anatomy. The practice of medicine took a rapid turn with physicians being more systematic in the diagnosis of diseases. The development and use of antiseptic and anaesthesia also increased in operations. Effective cures to many fatal diseases were discovered during this era. Improvement in public health was given utmost importance, and many hospitals were developed. The mid 18th century and early 19th century was the period when medicine was heavily professionalized. With the advancement in medicine, new career options opened up for women as well. They were appointed as nurses and physicians.</p>

                        <h3>Stethoscope</h3>
                        <p>Before the stethoscope was invented, doctors would listen to their patient's heartbeats by putting their ears onto their chests, a quite crude and inefficient method. For instance, if there was considerable insulation between the actual heart and the exterior of his chest in the form of fat, this method failed.French physician René Laënnec faced a similar situation when he couldn't accurately judge one of his patients' heart rates on account that the patient had too much fat on him. He invented the 'stethoscope,' creating a trumpet-shaped wooden tube that amplified sounds coming from the lungs and the heart. That principle of sound amplification has yet to change.</p>

                        <h3>Radiography</h3>
                        <p>It’s hard to imagine the correct diagnosis and treatment of injuries as common as fractures without x-ray imaging technology. X-rays were accidentally discovered when German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen was studying electric currents passing through a gas of extremely low pressure.He observed that in a darkened room, the cathode ray tube covered with barium platinocyanide caused a fluorescent effect. Since the cathode rays are invisible, he didn’t know what the rays were and named it X-radiation for its unknown nature. He won the first-ever Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery.The initial reception to the discovery, however, was met with hostility and mockery with a New York Times journalist referring to it as “an alleged discovery of a method to photograph the invisible”.</p>

                        <p>Among modern medicines, antibiotics probably hold the most importance. Alexander Fleming, one of the pioneers who invented medicine, was the one to introduce this miracle drug to the world. His invention led to the foundation of resistance against bacterial diseases. In due course of time, Paul Ehlrich and Alfred Bertheim were the ones to introduce an antibiotic named Salvarsan in 1907. Since then, we have developed remarkable antibiotic molecules to counter bacterial growth and infectious diseases.</p>

                        <p>A hypodermic needle with its austere appearance and a simple working principle was invented only about 150 years ago. Before that in ancient Greece and Rome, physicians used thin hollow tools to inject fluids into the body. In 1656, a dog was given an intravenous injection via a goose quill by Christopher Wren.The modern hypodermic needle was invented by Charles Pravaz and Alexander Wood somewhere in the mid-1800s. Today, these needles are used to deliver the correct drug dosage in treatment and extract body fluids with minimal pain and risk of contamination.</p>

                        <p>This milestone invention was the fruit of two Australian scientists’ labor, Mark C. Hill and physicist Edgar H. Booth in 1926. The prototype was a portable setup consisting of two poles, one connected with a salt solution-soaked skin pad and the other to a needle that was inserted into the patient's heart chamber.Despite such a crude design they both successfully brought back to life a stillborn baby. Today pacemakers are much more sophisticated with an average battery life of 20 years.</p>

                        <p>The discovery of the x-rays led to a surge in the efforts to search for methods to access even more details without cutting open a body. This subsequently led to the invention of the CT scanner. Its commercial version was invented by Dr. Godfrey Hounsfield who received a Nobel Prize for medicine in 1979. This device was able to display multiple layers within multiple x-ray images.Soon after, Dr. Raymond V. Damadian invented a technique to differentiate between cancerous and normal cells using nuclear magnetic resonance which later was improved and called functional magnetic resonance imaging or MRI.</p>

                <p>The invention of prosthetics has been a big breakthrough, enabling the physically handicapped to live a life that is not limited to wheelchairs and crutches. Nevertheless, the first iterations of this invention were limiting. Over the years prosthesis technology has blossomed offering wearers more flexibility and mobility. Bionic prosthetics would eventually follow, coming to fruition in 1980. Modern bionic prosthetics are made from carbon fiber making them lighter and stronger than metal. The durable artificial limb is intuitive, features, inbuilt myoelectric sensors that enable gripping and holding, may incorporate 3D printed technologies, can connect to a wearer's mind, and may eventually allow wearers to feel objects again. It will be interesting to see how artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to improve the modern bionic prosthesis.</p>

                        <h3>The Artificial Heart </h3>
                        <p>The heart is the most important organ in our body, keeping us alive and transporting blood to various parts of our body. One of the leading causes of death is heart disease.  Aside from standard medication and medical treatments, transplants are a great option to combat these statistics.Yet, the number of patients who need a heart transplant far exceeds the supply. Though the ideas of the artificial heart can be traced all the way back to Jean Cesar LeGallois in 1812, with multiple variations over time, Dr. Robert Jarvik is the first person to create a permanent artificial heart, in 1982. The artificial heart has evolved over the decades saving countless lives. </p>

                <p>Whether creating a megaproject or single-family home, the construction industry has become increasingly focused on sustainability. Society as a whole has grown more aware of climate change, the depletion of natural resources, and the human impact on natural habitats. Historically, sustainable construction has focused on the operations phase of assets. But the sustainability of construction processes is becoming increasingly important as well. Industry stakeholders are already starting to reduce the environmental impact of construction, and it will continue to be a key focal point in the future.</p>
                <p>Digital transformation in construction is picking up, and will play a critical role in solving sustainability and other persistent challenges in the industry. Construction firms are adopting technology to improve efficiency, reduce risk, and make data-driven decisions, challenges that became even more acute during the pandemic.</p>
